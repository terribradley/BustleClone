# Bustle-clone

This app mimics the Bustle Clone newsite using Ember.js and Sass.  We set up an admin route that allows the user to add, update and delete news stories. There is also a route for each news story, so a viwer can click a link on the homepage and be redirected to a more fleshed out news item.
